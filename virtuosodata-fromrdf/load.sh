## Most statements here are debugging, to check that files in the Docker containers are where expected.
## Purpose is to move/copy file 'staging.sql' into '/staging' where the 'staging.sh' script already in
## the stain/virtuoso image will load the 'staging.sql' file.
## Ended up with 2-step process: in Dockerfile, COPY staging.sql to '/'. Then here, copy it to
## '/staging/'. Why? It worked. Direct method must have initially failed.

## ToDo: clean up, perhaps refactor how 'staging.sh' and 'staging.sql' work.
